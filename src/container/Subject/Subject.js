	  			You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. 
	        	Each character in S is a type of stone you have. 
	        	You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
				The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters.
				Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

				<div>
					<b>Example 1:</b> <br />
					Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb" <br />
					Output: 3

				<div>
					<b>Example 2:</b> <br />
						Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ" <br />
						Output: 0 <br />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>	
				<b>Note:</b> <br />
				• S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50. <br />
				• The characters in J are distinct.
